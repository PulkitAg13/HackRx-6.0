# HackRx-6.0 - LLM-Powered Intelligent Query-Retrieval System
An intelligent document processing and query system that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to handle complex queries across insurance, legal, HR, and compliance domains. The system processes various document formats and provides contextual, explainable responses with semantic search capabilities.

# Features

- Multi-format Document Processing: Supports PDFs, DOCX, and email documents
- Semantic Search: Uses FAISS/Pinecone embeddings for intelligent document retrieval
- Contextual Decision Making: LLM-powered analysis with explainable rationale
- Clause Matching: Advanced semantic similarity matching for policy and contract clauses
- Structured Responses: JSON-formatted outputs for easy integration
- Real-world Domain Support: Optimized for insurance, legal, HR, and compliance use cases

# System Architecture 

The system consists of 6 core components working in sequence:
[Input Documents] ‚Üí [LLM Parser] ‚Üí [Embedding Search] ‚Üí [Clause Matching] ‚Üí [Logic Evaluation] ‚Üí [JSON Output]

# Component Details

Input Documents: Handles PDF blob URLs and document ingestion
LLM Parser: Extracts and structures queries using GPT-4
Embedding Search: FAISS/Pinecone-based semantic retrieval
Clause Matching: Semantic similarity analysis for relevant clauses
Logic Evaluation: Decision processing with contextual reasoning
JSON Output: Structured response generation

# Tech Stack 

Backend: FastAPI (Python)
LLM: GPT-4 (OpenAI)
Vector Database: Pinecone
Database: PostgreSQL
Document Processing: PyPDF2, python-docx, email libraries
Embeddings: OpenAI Embeddings API
Semantic Search: FAISS/Pinecone

# Pre-requisites

Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- PostgreSQL 12+
- OpenAI API key
- Pinecone API key (if using Pinecone over FAISS)

# Performance

Document Processing: ~2-5 seconds per document (depending on size)
Query Response Time: ~1-3 seconds average
Accuracy: 90%+ on domain-specific queries
Supported File Size: Up to 50MB per document
Concurrent Users: Scales horizontally with FastAPI

# Security

All API endpoints require authentication
Document uploads are scanned for malware
Sensitive data is encrypted at rest
Rate limiting implemented for API endpoints
